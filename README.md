# ðŸ’³ Credit Risk Scoring Model

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project aims to build a **Credit Risk Scoring Model** that predicts whether a loan applicant is a **Good** or **Bad** credit risk.  
The system uses **machine learning models (Logistic Regression and XGBoost)**, feature engineering (credit utilization, debt-to-income ratio), and model explainability tools (SHAP and LIME).

A **Streamlit web application** is included for real-time predictions.
